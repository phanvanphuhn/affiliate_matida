```
yarn
```

2. Install postinstall

```
yarn postinstall 
```

3. Install pod IOS

```
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Step 3: Develop the App
1. Open your preferred code editor or IDE and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start the development server by running the following command in the project directory:

```
yarn start
```
after
```
// For Android:
npx react-native run-android
